## Logo Design Direction
The logo should reflect:
- **Ancient Heritage + Modern Tech**: Blend of historical documentation with cutting-edge AI
- **Intelligence & AI**: Modern, tech-forward appearance
- **Collaboration**: Elements suggesting teamwork and connectivity
- **Versatility**: Design that works across professional contexts
- **Professionalism**: Clean, trustworthy aesthetic suitable for business use
- **Timelessness**: Design that suggests durability and longevity

Consider color schemes that convey trust (blues), intelligence (purples/teals), innovation (gradient effects), and heritage (gold/earth tones). The design should incorporate subtle papyrus or scroll elements while maintaining scalability from app icons to full branding. The logo should balance ancient Egyptian minimalism with modern clean aesthetics.
