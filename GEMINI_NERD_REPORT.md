# 🤓 Gemini's Nerd Report: Social Garden SOW Workbench

Alright, I've done a deep dive into your codebase. Here's the breakdown from your friendly neighborhood AI nerd.

## 🛠️ The Stack (The "Cool Kid" Tools)

You're running a pretty modern setup here. It's like you went shopping in the "Trending" section of GitHub:

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15.1.4 (Living on the edge, I see. App Router is in full force.)
*   **Language:** TypeScript 5.4.2 (Because `any` is a crime.)
*   **Editor:** Novel (Notion-style WYSIWYG. Very slick.)
*   **AI:** Vercel AI SDK + Z.AI (GLM-4.6) (Custom providers? Fancy.)
*   **Chat:** Tambo AI SDK (Integrating chat directly into the workflow.)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Radix UI (The industry standard for "I want it to look good without writing 5000 lines of CSS.")
*   **Database:** MySQL (Classic. Reliable. No complaints here.)

## 🧐 Code Quality & Patterns

### The Good
*   **Architecture Plan:** You actually have an `ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md`. This puts you in the top 1% of projects I see. It's detailed and tracks progress. 
*   **Component Organization:** `components/` seems reasonably structured. You've got `elements/` for smaller bits and specific folders for features like `sow/`.
*   **Custom AI Provider:** You've correctly wired up Z.AI in `app/api/generate/route.ts` to impersonate OpenAI for the Vercel SDK. That's a clever hack to get standard tooling working with a custom model.
*   **Brand Alignment:** You've centralized your brand colors in `tailwind.config.js`. `sg-dark` and `sg-green`. Nice and maintainable.

### The "Needs Homework" (Room for Improvement)
*   **Route Handler Security:** In `app/api/generate/route.ts`, you're checking for `ZAI_API_KEY` existence, but relying on IP-based rate limiting via Upstash. Just make sure that `ZAI_API_KEY` never leaks to the client. Since `runtime = "edge"`, verify that your environment variables are properly accessible in the edge runtime (Next.js sometimes gets finicky with this).
*   **"Any Human or AI" Warning:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` has a big scary warning. I like the discipline, but let's hope the humans actually read it.
*   **Missing Implementations:** You've got a lot of "0% Complete" in Phase 2, 3, and 4. 
    *   **Database:** I see `mysql2` in dependencies but haven't seen the actual schema setup files yet (referenced in `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as a TODO).
    *   **State Management:** You're using `useState` and `localStorage` in `page.tsx` for layout. For a complex app like this (documents, workspaces, chat state), you might eventually want something more robust like Zustand or Jotai, especially when you start linking documents to chat threads.
    *   **Type Safety:** I saw `dummy.pdf` and `test.txt` in the root. Don't commit test files to production! (I know, I know, it's a workbench).

## 🚀 Next Steps (According to the Nerd)

Based on your `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and my analysis, here is where you should focus your "nerd energy":

1.  **Database Schema:** You need to actually create those tables. `workspaces`, `documents`, `pricing_data`. Without this, the frontend is just a pretty shell.
2.  **Tambo Integration:** You have the chat UI (`SidebarChat`), but the "linking" between a document and a thread is the killer feature. You need a data model that supports `document_id <-> thread_id`.
3.  **PDF Export:** `html2pdf.js` and `jspdf` are in `package.json`. Implementing a *clean* export that respects page breaks and CSS is notoriously annoying. Start early.

## 🤓 Final Verdict

It's a solid start. You've got the bones of a really powerful tool. It's not just a "wrapper"; you're building a specific workflow (SOW generation) which is where the real value of AI lies.

**Rating:** 8/10 (Would pair-program again).
